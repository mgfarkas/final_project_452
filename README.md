# final project 452
final project for IS 452 AO class

I'm Michael. I'm an archaeologist as well as a MSLIS Student at the iSchool and the University of Illinois


This project entails creation of Python code to read through some fairly standardized archaeological compliance documents and extract some key elements. These will be saved as a CSV file for use in creation of, or, later importing new records into, a database containing the key elements of these documents.

Initially I was looking at Textract, PyPDF2, and pdfminer to extract pdf text into plain text. 

This will hopefully be a later addition to my code. For now, the files were converted to plain text using Acrobat.
