## looping through a directory of files

# below reads a directory and accumulates the file names when files are text

import os


# setting path variable to the directory where the files are stored
path = 'files'

folder = os.fsencode(path)

# checking if I can accumulate the file names as a list
txtfilenames = []

for file in os.listdir(folder):
    filename = os.fsdecode(file)
    if filename.endswith( ('.txt') ):
#slicing off the file extension
        txtfilenames.append(filename[0:-4])

# printing the length of the list to ensure I am only collecting text files
print(len(txtfilenames))
# printing the list of file names
print(txtfilenames)
